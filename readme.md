project 1 by mike jones WDI15 

technologies used : JS, HTML, CSS, jQuery, soundManager

concept: the aim was to recreate an old arcade style multiplayer 8bit game using a mixture jQuery, HTML, CSS and soundmanager.

The basic HTML CSS give a good retro feel using sprites and 8bit artwork.
the js and jQuery do the basic movement, battle and destruction properties using a mth.random to decide when and how the tanks battle each other. I used a math.random to add fairness to the game so when player 1 presses 'w' and player 2 presses 'l' it fires off tanks that will battle and the winner decided by pure chance. the losing player then has the chance to fire off another tank to help save itself. The game ends when one players garage is destroyed. 

No instalation required as it is a web based game
